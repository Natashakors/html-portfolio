<h1> Best movies according to Natasha </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies for all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Humour and violence - shocking, but without moral depth.</p>
<h3>Lost in Translation</h3>
<p>Cinematic cherry blossom.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>itâ€™s a movie with the power to coax out the inner child in the most grown-up and jaded among us.</p>
